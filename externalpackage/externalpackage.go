// Package externalpackage
// FIXME This is a sample package. Please delete this after you figured out what this package means.
// This is an example of some external packages (i.e., libraries) that can be imported by other projects.
// Please note that packages can be easily moved between internal and external.
// So I recommend to put them in the internal directory at first, and move it if needed.
// Unless you are sure that this is a library.
// Something may be categorised as an external package:
// 1. Networking (may be used in collectors and marketplace)
// 2. Storage (may be used in marketplace)
